## Zap
Zap is a networking solution for Roblox, creating code based on configuration done through it's own IDL. Documentation is available [here](https://zap.redblox.dev/), and an extension that adds syntax highlighting and autocomplete for the IDL is available [here](https://github.com/VirtualButFake/zap-vscode).
