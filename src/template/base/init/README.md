**A project made using create-roblox.**

</div>

## Getting Started

In order to start running your project, run `lune run dev`. This will start a Rojo server alongside Darklua (if applicable), so you can use string requires even when actively developing.
If you want to build your project, run `lune run build`. This will build your project into a `.rbxl` or `.rbxm` file, which can be used in Roblox Studio. Keep in mind that unless you include your models in the `src` folder, they will not be included in the build, and you will need to sync them manually.

Below, you can find a list of all the tools and libraries that are included in this project, and the links to relevant pages.
