## [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally)

Wally is a package manager for Roblox, created by Uplift Games. Some packages may be installed with your project by default. In order to add new packages, modify `wally.toml`. You can search for packages on [wally.run](https://wally.run/). If you wish to install the added packages, run `lune run install-packages` in your terminal. This will automatically export the types and rename the folder (if needed).
