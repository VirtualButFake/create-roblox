## Darklua String Requires
Through Darklua, string requires (such as ``require("@packages/package")``) are converted into Roblox path-based requires. This allows for a more flexible and modular project structure, and allows for the use of modules in a more straightforward manner. To add new paths, add them in ``.darklua.json`` and make sure to add them in ``.vscode/settings.json`` as well so Luau LSP recognizes them.
