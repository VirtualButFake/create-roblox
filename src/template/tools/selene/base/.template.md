## [Selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene)

Selene is a Lua linter. It can be used in Visual Studio Code to give real-time feedback on your code if you have the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kampfkarren.selene-vscode) installed, or can be used in a CI workflow to ensure that your code is consistent and does not make common mistakes. In order to check your codebase, run `selene src` in your terminal. This will automatically check your code for common mistakes and inconsistencies.
