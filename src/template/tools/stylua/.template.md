## [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)
StyLua is a code formatter that can be used both in your editor and CI workflows. When enabled, it is automatically enabled in your editor, if you have the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua) installed. In order to style your codebase without your editor, run `stylua src` in your terminal. This will automatically format your code to be consistent with the style guide.
