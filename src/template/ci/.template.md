## CI (Continuous Integration)

Developers are prone to having their own programming style, which is solved using StyLua and Selene in the CI workflow. When a pull request occurs or a new commit is pushed to the master branch, StyLua and Selene will evaluate the current code and report any issues or styling errors. This ensures that the codebase is consistent and follows the same style. This could be expanded further by adding a testing workflow to ensure that not just the style is consistent, but also the functionality of the code.
